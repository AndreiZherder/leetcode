"""
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums representing the score of students in an exam.
The teacher would like to form one non-empty group of students with maximal strength,
where the strength of a group of students of indices
i0, i1, i2, ... , ik is defined as nums[i0] * nums[i1] * nums[i2] * ... * nums[ik].

Return the maximum strength of a group the teacher can create.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,-1,-5,2,5,-9]
Output: 1350
Explanation: One way to form a group of maximal strength is to group the students at indices [0,2,3,4,5].
Their strength is 3 * (-5) * 2 * 5 * (-9) = 1350, which we can show is optimal.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-4,-5,-4]
Output: 20
Explanation: Group the students at indices [0, 1] . Then, weâ€™ll have a resulting strength of 20.
We cannot achieve greater strength.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 13
-9 <= nums[i] <= 9
