"""
You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has two main properties:
attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array properties where properties[i] = [attacki, defensei]
represents the properties of the ith character in the game.

A character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than
this character's attack and defense levels. More formally,
a character i is said to be weak if there exists another character j where attackj > attacki and defensej > defensei.

Return the number of weak characters.



Example 1:

Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.
Example 2:

Input: properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The first character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
Example 3:

Input: properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.


Constraints:

2 <= properties.length <= 10^5
properties[i].length == 2
1 <= attacki, defensei <= 10^5
